# chatbot-project
Educational project focused on building a simple chatbot from scratch. Demonstrates basic principles of conversational AI, message handling, and interaction flow.

# Digital Factory's FAQ Demo (Phase 1)
- Minimal, frontend-only demo (no backend, no styling). 
- Input + button → shows an answer in a modal and logs to the console.

## Run locally
- Open `index.html` in a browser.

## Edit FAQ / logic
- In `index.html`, update the `FAQ` array (id, keywords, examples, answer).
- Keep the function `answerQuestion(message)` unchanged (used by the UI now and by a future `/chat` backend later).
